# About
A lot of exported JDM cars has piggyback ECU F-CON iS produced by HKS company.
Since this ECU has no free software to tuning it up, I've start to make own utils to resolve this problem.

# TODO list:

- [X] Tool for converting iS PowerWriter files to CSV 
- [ ] Tool for getting password from ECU
- [ ] Tool for reading/writing ECU calibrations to/from file
- [ ] Tool for editing ECU calibration's files
- [ ] Tool for ECU online calibration
